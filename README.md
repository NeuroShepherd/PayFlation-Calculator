# Payflation Calculator: A Shiny App

This is a minor, albeit practical and useful, project to build a Shiny app wherein users can determine their inflation-adjusted return/salary increase over a given time period. 

Most people are familiar with the concept that prices of goods and services increase commensurate with inflation (or more accurately, inflation is a measure of these price increases over time. And yes, strictly speaking, there can be deflation or decreases in prices from year-to-year, and this is accounted for in the background math.) However, one important aspect to the upward march of prices is that one's salary *should* increase, at minimum, at the rate of yearly inflation. Anything less than that would be a negative real return (AKA a salary decrease) even if there was no nominal decrease/loss of money.

The explanation above might make intuitive sense to some people, but I would defer to [Investopedia's page on Real Rate of Return](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realrateofreturn.asp) for a more in-depth explanation of real returns vs. nominal returns.
